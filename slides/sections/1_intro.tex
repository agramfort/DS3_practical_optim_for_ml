    \alert{Goal}: from examples $(x_1, y_1), \dots, (x_n, y_n)$ learn a function $h: \bbR^p \rightarrow R$ such that 
    \begin{equation*}
        h(x_{n+1}) \simeq y_{n+1}
    \end{equation*}

\alert{Ideally}, for a given loss function $L$ :
\begin{equation*}
    h^* \in \argmin_{h \in \cH} \underbrace{\bbE [L(h(x), y)]}_{\text{Risk}}
\end{equation*}

\pause 

\alert{In practice}:
\begin{equation*}
    h^* 
    \in 
    \argmin_{h \in \cH} 
    \underbrace{\sum_i^n L(h(x_i), y_i)}_{\text{Empirical risk}}
